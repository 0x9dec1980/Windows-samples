Module Name:

    receive.c

Abstract:

    This module contains the Miniport packet receive routines.

    This driver conforms to the NDIS 3.0 Miniport interface.

Author:

Environment:

    Windows NT 3.5 kernel mode Miniport driver or equivalent.

    IN PHTDSU_ADAPTER   Adapter

/*+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called from HtDsuHandleInterrupt to handle a
    packet receive interrupt.  We enter here with interrupts enabled
    on the adapter and the processor, but the Adapter->Lock is held.

    We examine the adapter memory beginning where the adapter would have
    stored the next packet.
    As we find each good packet it is passed up to the protocol stack.
    This code assumes that the receive buffer holds a single packet.

    NOTE: The Adapter->Lock must be held before calling this routine.

Arguments:

    Adapter _ A pointer ot our adapter information structure.

Return Value:

    None.
