How to Obtain a Virtual Device ID Number
=========================================

Summary:

In the DECLARE_VIRTUAL_DEVICE line of every VxD is the "VxD ID" field.
This field will be either a unique number assigned to that virtual
device, or the constant Undefined_Device_ID.

Certain virtual devices for Windows must a have unique identifier.
A VxD that calls an MS-DOS device or a terminate-and-stay-resident
program must have an ID. An ID is also required for a VxD that provides any
of the following:

   - Service(s)
   - a V86 mode API
   - a protected mode API

In addition, Windows provides no protection against loading a VxD using 
Undefined_Device_ID more than once.  When Windows loads, it gets a list of 
all virtual devices to be loaded (through the INT 2fh, AX=1605h broadcast and 
the SYSTEM.INI file).  If a particular VxD is specified more than once and it
uses Undefined_Device_ID, that VxD will be loaded multiple times.  If,
however, the virtual device has its own unique ID, Windows will recognize
the situation, inform the user, and abort the loading process (unless there
is code in the VxD to allow Windows to continue).

In order to get a unique VxD ID, the form below needs to filled out and
returned to Microsoft.  Via electronic-mail, the form can be sent to the
Internet address:   vxdid@microsoft.com
This address can be reached from any service that has Internet access.
This includes Compuserve, MCI Mail, etc.

A prefix may be required to connect to InterNet. For example,
CompuServe mail would be addressed as follows:

   >INTERNET:vxdid@microsoft.com

Alternately, you can fax this information to Windows DDK Product
Support, at 1-206-93MS-FAX or mail the information to:

   Windows DDK Product Support Services
   Microsoft Corporation
   One Microsoft Way
   Redmond, Washington 98052-6399

(E-mail is preferred and will probably have faster turn around time.)
