=============================================================================
EATPAGES.386

This VxD demonstrates the use of the Linked List services, as well
as the System Page Allocator functions. The VxD will simply allocate
half of the free physical pages at boot time, and free them at
system exit. This can be useful to simulate low memory conditions.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall _GetDemandPageInfo
         VMMCall _PageAllocate
         VMMCall _PageFree
         VMMCall List_Create
         VMMCall List_Allocate      
         VMMCall List_Attach_Tail   
         VMMCall List_Get_First
         VMMCall List_Get_Next      
         VMMCall List_Remove        
         VMMCall List_Deallocate    

=============================================================================
GENERIC.386

The basic structure of a VxD is illustrated by this VxD. As written, 
it can be loaded although it performs no function. This VxD can be 
used as a base set of source files to start a VxD project. 

=============================================================================
GPTRAP.386

This VxD uses the Hook_PM_Fault to catch GP faults.  When this VxD receives
control because of a GP fault, it will execute an INT 1.  If execution is
continued, control is passed to the next handler in the fault handler chain.

The "VxDStub" code for this VxD is an example in itself.  The stub hooks
INT 2Fh then terminates with stay resident.  When Windows later loads,
this TSR responds to the INT 2Fh, AX=1605h (Windows initialization)
broadcast.  The TSR returns a structure that will cause the VxD to be loaded.
Thus, no "device=" line is required in the SYSTEM.INI file.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall Hook_PM_Fault

=============================================================================
VDIALOG.386

The purpose of this sample VxD is to demonstrate the basic use of the 
Install_IO_Handler and Shell_Resolve_Contention function calls. The 
Install_IO_Handler call enables this VxD to trap IN and OUT's to a port
from any VM.  The Shell_Resolve_Contention call is then used to display a
dialog box when another VM attempts to use a port that is already assigned 
to another VM.

This VxD also demonstrates the use of Enable_Local_Trapping and 
Disable_Local_Trapping to allow the owner of the port in question to 
freely do I/O to the port without overhead.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall Install_IO_Handler
         VMMCall Enable_Local_Trapping 
         VMMCall Disable_Local_Trapping

         VxDCall Shell_Resolve_Contention

=============================================================================
VFINTD.386

This sample has been provided to demonstrate the technique of 
handling the virtualization of a particular IRQ.

Uses the following services:
         VxDCall VPICD_Virtualize_IRQ
         VxDCall VPICD_Set_Int_Request
         VxDCall VPICD_Clear_Int_Request
         VxDCall VPICD_Phys_EOI

=============================================================================
VIDLED.386

This VxD demonstrates how to use the Call_When_Idle function.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall Call_When_Idle

=============================================================================
VITD.386

This VxD provides a simulation of a hardware interval timer for virtual
machines. To install it, build VITD.386, place the final VITD.386 in
the Windows SYSTEM directory, and add a "device=VITD.386" line in the 
[386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI and restart Windows.

Please see the README.TXT file, and source files for more detailed
information.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall _Allocate_Device_CB_Area
         VMMCall Fatal_Memory_Error

         VMMCall Get_VM_Exec_Time        
         VMMCall Cancel_Time_Out         
         VMMCall Call_Priority_VM_Event  
         VMMCall Begin_Nest_Exec            
         VMMCall Exec_Int

=============================================================================
VKXD.386

This VxD makes the F9 key act as the ALT-ENTER keypress sequence.
It shows how to use the Force_Keys API of the Virtual Keyboard
Device (VKD).

Uses the following services:
         VxDCall VKD_Define_Hot_Key
         VxDCall VKD_Cancel_Hot_Key_State
         VxDCall VKD_Force_Keys

=============================================================================
VMIOD.386

This VxD can be used to monitor the I/O traffic associated with a particular
device. Specifically, IN's and OUT's to a single I/O port will trigger 
debugging output on the secondary monitor of the system.  Note that you 
must have a secondary monitor to use this VxD.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall Install_IO_Handler
         VMMCall Get_Profile_Hex_Int       
         VMMCall Clear_Mono_Screen
         VMMCall Set_Mono_Cur_Pos
         VMMCall Out_Mono_String

=============================================================================
VMIRQD.386

This VxD can be used to monitor the activity associated with a particular
hardware interrupt (IRQ). Specifically, hardware interrupts, EOIs, IRETs,
virtual interrupts, and mask changes associated with a particular IRQ
will trigger debugging output on the secondary monitor of the system.  
Note that you must have a secondary monitor to use this VxD.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall Get_Profile_Decimal_Int   
         VMMCall Clear_Mono_Screen
         VMMCall Set_Mono_Cur_Pos
         VMMCall Out_Mono_String

         VxDCall VPICD_Clear_Int_Request
         VxDCall VPICD_Phys_EOI

=============================================================================
VMPAGES.386

This VxD demonstrates how to export a VxD service (in this case GetVMPgCount),
to an application.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall _GetVMPgCount

=============================================================================
VNMID.386

This VxD shows how to hook the NMI (Non-maskable interrupt). It
currently does not actually DO anything with the NMI except to
chain to the previous handler.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall Get_NMI_Handler_Addr      
         VMMCall Set_NMI_Handler_Addr
         VMMCall Hook_NMI_Event

=============================================================================
VPOSTD.386

This collection of programs demonstrates one way a VxD can cause a message
to be posted to a Windows application.  This example also shows a fairly
useful implementation of real and protected mode APIs.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall _Allocate_Device_CB_Area
         VMMCall Fatal_Memory_Error
         VMMCall Get_Sys_VM_Handle
         VMMCall Test_Sys_VM_Handle

         VMMCall End_Nest_Exec

=============================================================================
VWATCHD.386

VwatchD is a Virtual Device that demonstrates the basic structure of 
a VxD.  This VxD issues a Trace_Out (ie: sends messages to the COMx:
port) at it's entry points.  By watching the messages it displays, you
can study the situations which cause the various VxD entry points to 
be called.  

This VxD shows all major entry points, VERY simple APIs (separate APIs
for V86 mode as well as PM mode), and a "debug_dump" section.

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall _Allocate_Device_CB_Area
         VMMCall Get_System_Time

         VxDCall VwatchD_Get_Version

=============================================================================
VWFD.386

This VxD, when installed on a system running Windows in enhanced mode,
allows DOS applications to determine if they are running in a window
or full-screen. TSTWF.ASM is a sample DOS program that uses the VWFD
API. 

Uses the following services:
         VMMCall _Allocate_Device_CB_Area
         VMMCall Fatal_Memory_Error
         VMMCall Hook_Device_Service     
         VMMCall Get_Next_VM_Handle
