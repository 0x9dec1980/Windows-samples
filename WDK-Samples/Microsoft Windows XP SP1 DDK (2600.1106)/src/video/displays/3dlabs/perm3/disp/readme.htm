</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>


<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
This is a display driver for graphics adapters based
on the 3Dlabs Permedia-3 chipset. 
It supports GDI acceleration, Microsoft DirectDraw&#174; acceleration, Microsoft Direct3D&#174; acceleration,
and multiple monitor support.

This display driver forms a matched pair with the 3Dlabs Permedia3 video miniport driver. The miniport driver is responsible for non-rendering tasks such as adapter initialization, register mapping, and other resource allocation, whereas the display driver handles actual rendering tasks.<p>

This sample driver runs on Windows® 2000 on the x86 platform. It also builds and runs on Windows 98 and Windows ME.<P>

The driver is compiled as a DX8 driver and currently supports pointsprites, multisampling, volume textures and DX8 multistreaming (with a single stream). 

<H3>RELEASE NOTES</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>

All applicable samples and DCT tests have been run successfully with this driver.
