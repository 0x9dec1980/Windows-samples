RoutineDescription:
    This routine creates a HidDevice object that corresponds to a "logical" device
    A logical device is actually preparsed data that has been saved to disk.  The 
    most common method of saving preparsed data to disk is using that feature in a
    post 3.0 version of HIDView after retrieving/parsing with report descriptor with
    the OS provided parser.  Because the preparsed data structure is available, 
    all of the HidP_Xxx routines can be used.

    OptFileName is an optional file name to specify.  If it is NULL, an OPENFILE
    dialog box is displayed to allow the user to select which Ppd structure to
    load.

    Return value indicates the success or failure of the device load
