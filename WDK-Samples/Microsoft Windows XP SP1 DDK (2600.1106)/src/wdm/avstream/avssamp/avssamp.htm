<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P>

The Avssamp sample provides a filter-centric AVStream capture driver.

The driver performs captures at 320x240 in either an RGB24 or YUV422 format.
The purpose of the sample is to demonstrate how to write a filter-centric AVStream minidriver.

<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P>

Build the sample by typing <B>build -zc</B> in either the standard checked or free build
environment. A successful build produces <i>avssamp.sys.</i> 
To install the driver, right click on <i>avssamp.inf</i> and select Install.
When prompted for <i>avssamp.sys</i>, select the built binary.<p>


The sample works on x86 platforms and builds 
correctly using Microsoft&#174; Visual C&#174; 6.0. The driver uses Plug and Play. 
<P> 
This sample runs on Microsoft® Windows® 2000 and Windows XP®.

<P>

<b>DriverEntry</b> in <i>device.cpp</i> is the initial point of entry.  This routine passes control to
AVStream through a call to <b>KsInitializeDriver</b>.  In this call, the minidriver passes the device descriptor, 
an AVStream structure that
recursively defines the AVStream object hierarchy for a driver.

This is common behavior for an AVStream minidriver.
<p>

<i>Filter.cpp</i> is where the sample lays out the KSPIN_DESCRIPTOR_EX structure for the single video pin.
Pin descriptor structures are provided for three additional pins, but the sample does not currently use these.
They are provided to make it easy to extend this sample driver.
<p>

The filter dispatch structure provides dispatches to create, close, and process, all three routines
being included in <i>Filter.cpp</i>. Note that the process dispatch is provided in KSFILTER_DISPATCH since
this sample is filter-centric.

<i>Filter.cpp</i> is also where the    

KSPIN_DISPATCH structure for the unique pin is provided. 

<p>

See comments in all .cpp files.  Also see complete AVStream documentation in the DDK documentation.


<p>
<H3>RUNNING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<p>
Once installation is
complete, access the driver through the graphedt tool. <i>Graphedt.exe</i> is available
in the <i>Tools</i> directory of the DDK.
In the Graphedt application, click the Graph menu and select Insert Filters.  
The sample appears under "WDM Streaming Capture Devices"
as "avssamp Source."  
Click Insert Filter and the sample appears in the graph as a single filter labelled as avssamp Source.
Attach this filter to either a DirectShow Video Renderer or the VMR default video renderer and click Play.

<p>

The output produced by the sample is a 320x240 image of standard EIA-189-A color bars.
