</span></i></b>This document accompanies a sample co-installer that copies additional INF files during a device installation. These
instructions apply for the Microsoft® Windows® 2000 and Windows XP and Server 2003
operating systems.

<p>Note that support for the <b>CopyINF</b> directive discussed
in this document is built into the Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 operating systems.

<H3>SUMMARY</H3>
This document accompanies a sample co-installer that can be used in conjunction
with an INF file to install additional device INF files on the target system
during a device installation. The instructions herein apply to the Microsoft
Windows 2000 and Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 operating systems.

<p>The sample co-installer described in this article interprets <b>CopyINF</b>
directives in a [<i>DDInstall</i>] section in an INF file. The sample
demonstrates using a co-installer to perform processing after a device has been
installed, parsing the INF section that is being used for the installation, and
the use of the SetupCopyOEMInf, SetupGetInfInformation,
SetupQueryInfOriginalFileInformation and SetupDiGetActualSectionToInstall APIs.

<p>If you wish to use the “CopyINF” directive to copy
multiple INF files from a single INF file on a target Windows® 2000 system,
refer to the document on using the redistributable “CoCpyINF.DLL” provided
with this DDK.

<H3>HOW IT WORKS</H3>

<p>The co-installer is registered as part of device installation via
a [<i>DDInstall</i>.CoInstallers] section. After the co-installer has been
registered, it will receive device installation callbacks for the remainder of the install.

<p>When the co-installer receives the DIF_INSTALLDEVICE callback the first time it is
called (Context-&gt;PostProcessing is FALSE), it returns a status of
ERROR_DI_POSTPROCESSING_REQUIRED. This return code causes the co-installer to be called
again once the install has been completed. The device installation will then invoke other
co-installers. The class installer or the default installer will do the actual
installation. All co-installers that returned ERROR_DI_POSTPROCESSING_REQUIRED will then be
called in reverse order, with Context-&gt;PostProcessing set to TRUE and Context-&gt;InstallResult
specifying if the install succeeded.

<p>This sample will call PostProcessInstallDevice only if the install succeeded. If it appears
that this is a new INF file (that has not previously been copied to the system INF directory), it
will look for all “CopyINF” keywords in the [<i>DDInstall</i>] section. For each matching
keyword, it will retrieve all the filenames to the right of the '=' and call SetupCopyOEMInf for each one.

<p>The syntax of the <b>CopyINF</b> directive is:
<p style="margin-left:.25in">[<em>DDInstall</em>]<br>
<b>CopyINF =</b> <em>filename.inf</em><i>[</i><strong>,</strong><em>filename2.inf]</em>...

<p>For a detailed example, see the two co-installer sample INF files provided in the Install subdirectory.

<p><b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">The CoCpyInf example uses a published but
    previously undocumented API: SetupQueryInfOriginalFileInformation. This API
    returns the original name of an OEM INF file.
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p class="Lp1">If the current INF file name and the original INF file name are
  different, then the CoCpyInf example assumes that the INF file has already
  been copied and will not perform the file copies.
  
  <p class="Lp1">When a device installation from a third-party INF occurs, that
  INF is copied to the system INF directory under a unique OEM<i>&lt;n&gt;</i>.inf<b>
  </b>name. The sample co-installer determines whether the additional <b>CopyINF</b>
  actions are necessary, depending on whether the INF’s original name differs
  from its current name. If the two names are the same, then the INF has not yet
  been installed into the INF directory, so the additional INF files are copied.
  If the INF’s original and current names differ, this indicates installation
  is from a third-party INF that already resides in the INF directory. In that
  case, the additional INF copy operations do not need to be performed, because
  they would have been copied previously.
  
  <p class="Lp1">Attempting to perform the additional copies in this scenario
  wouldn’t work anyway, because the third-party media is no longer available.
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Note:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
    creating a new public version of a co-installer, always give it a different
    unique name. Once a co-installer is installed, if it and a newer binary have
    the same name, the existing co-installer may be used instead.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Important:</b> The co-installer described in this article is available as a
redistributable binary in the &lt;ddkroot&gt;\tools\coinstallers subdirectory. If
you modify this co-installer for your own use, you must give it a new unique name. You
must also change the CopyINF directive to a different name -- such as CopyMyINFs -- and,
of course, change your co-installer to reference this new directive.

<H3>BUILDING THE CO-INSTALLER SAMPLE</H3>
<h5>To build the co-installer sample:</h5>
<ol><li>
<p class="MsoListNumber">Click the Free Build Environment or Checked Build Environment icon in the
Windows DDK program group to set basic environment variables needed by Windows.
<li>
<p class="MsoListNumber">In a command window, change to the directory containing the co-installer
device source code. For example:</li>
<blockquote>
<p><b>cd src\setup\cocpyinf</b>
</blockquote>
<li>
<p class="MsoListNumber">Modify the “sources” file to specify the new co-installer name.
<li>
<p class="MsoListNumber">Use the macro BLD or run the following from the command prompt:
</ol><blockquote>
<p><b>build –c</b>
<p>This invokes the Microsoft make routines that produce the Build.log, Build.wrn, and Build.err log files.
<p>When the build completes, the co-installer will be placed in the Lib\I386 subdirectory of the
&lt;TARGETPATH&gt; directory specified in the Sources file.
<p>If the build does not succeed, check for these errors:  1) the build environment is not set up
properly, or 2) modifications made to the sample source code introduced errors.
</blockquote>

<H3>USING THE CO-INSTALLER</H3>
<p><b>Note:  </b>If you wish to use the unmodified co-installer to provide the “CopyINF” directive on a target
Windows® 2000 system, refer to the document on using the redistributable “CoCpyINF.DLL” provided with this DDK.

<p>To use this co-installer, you must register it by adding a DDInstall.CoInstallers section to the INF file for your drivers. (Note that the
examples below use a new co-installer name, &quot;MyCoInst&quot;, and entry point, &quot;MyEntryFunction&quot;.)

<p><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>

Add a [<i>DDInstall</i>.CoInstallers] section for each device specified in the INF to register the co-installer and copy the co-installer
binary. For example:
<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">[InstallA.NT.CoInstallers]<br>
AddReg = CoCopyINF.AddReg<br>
CopyFiles= CoCopyINF.CopyFiles
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add an [<i>AddReg</i>] section to register the co-installer. For example:
<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">[CoCopyINF.AddReg]<br>
HKR,,CoInstallers32,0x10000,&quot;cocpyinf.DLL,CoCopyINF&quot;
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add a [<i>CopyFiles</i>] section to copy the co-installer binary. For example:
<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">[CoCopyINF.CopyFiles]<br>
cocpyinf.dll,,,0x10
</blockquote>

<p style="tab-stops:list .25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add an appropriate entry to the [DestinationDirs] section. For example:
<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">[DestinationDirs]<br>
CoCopyINF.CopyFiles = 11 ; %windir%\System32
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add sections to install the drivers.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">

For more information, see the sample INF files.

<H3>TESTING</H3>
<p>To ensure that the INF files are not in the system, type:
<p>Del %windir%\INF\OEM*.?NF
<p>Note that this step is only safe to do for testing purposes, and will delete any other third party
INF files that are present on the system. The system may be left in an unstable state.
<p>To ensure that an older version of the co-installer is not used, type:
<p>Del %windir%\System32\<i>YourCo-installerName</i>.dll
<p>Again, this step is only safe to do for testing purposes.
<p>Uninstall the devices in Device Manager.
<p>Install the devices by clicking on the &quot;Scan for
hardware changes&quot; item in the Device Manager Action Menu.
<p>Once all the relevant devices have been installed, you should
check that a re-install also works. Uninstall the devices in Device Manager
again (this time without removing the OEM*.?NF files) and click on &quot;Scan
for hardware changes&quot; again.
