<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
Firefly is a sample filter driver written with a purpose to demonstrate the following:
<UL>
<LI>Programming a HID device via kernel-mode IOCTLs
<OL>
<LI>Opening a HID collection of the target device in kernel-mode by using ZwCreateFile to get an handle to the device.

<LI>Using IOCTL_HID_xxx requests to obtain the HID collection's preparsed data and information.

<LI>Calling HidP_Xxx HID support routines to interpret HID reports. 

<LI>Using IOCTL_HID_SET_xxx or IOCTL_HID_GET_xxx to set or get feature reports.
</OL>
<LI>Providing a WMI interface to have a sideband communication with the usermode app.

<LI>Writing an INF file to install a device fiter driver on an existing HID device.

<LI>Showing how to open a WMI class in usermode and get or set data items using COM interfaces.
</UL>

<H3>Introduction to firefly sample</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" 
SIZE=2><P>

Firefly sample is installed as an upper filter driver of Microsoft USB Intellimouse Optical. An application provided with the sample can cause the light of the optical mouse to blink by sending commands to the filter driver using WMI interface.  The sample consists of:
<p>
<B>Driver </B>(firefly.sys): It's an upper device filter driver of mouse (mouhid.sys). This is a generic filter driver based on toaster filter driver sample available in this DDK. During start device, the driver registers a WMI class (FireflyDeviceInformation). The usermode application connects to WMI namespace (root\wmi) and opens this class using COM interfaces and makes call to set or get dataitem value (TailLit) of this class. In response to set WMI request, driver opens the HID collection using ZwCreateFile and calls IOCTL_HID_GET_COLLECTION_INFORMATION & IOCTL_HID_GET_COLLECTION_DESCRIPTOR to get the preparsed data. It then calls HidP_GetCaps using the preparsed data to get the capabilities of the device. After getting the capabilities of the device, the driver creates a feature report to set or clear the feature that causes the light to toggle.
<p>
<B>Library</B> (luminous.lib): All the interfaces required to access the WMI is defined in this library and exposed as CLuminous class.
<p>
<B>Application </B>(flicker.exe): The application links to luminous lib to open the WMI interfaces and send set request to toggle the light.
<p>
<B>Sauron </B>(sauron.dll): This is a windows media player visualization DLL. This DLL is created based on a sample from the Windows Media player SDK kit. By using this DLL, you can cause the mouse lights to blink to the beats of the music. Fun stuff to try out.

<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" 
SIZE=2><P>
To build the sample driver and test applications, you must first set up the DDK environment on your host machine. The “Installation and Release Notes” in the Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 DDK has a complete description on how to do this. 
 <OL> <LI>
Once the build environment is set up, run the build –ceZ command in the firefly directory. This will build the luminous.lib, firefly.sys, flicker.exe, and sauron.dll and place all these bits under the appropriate target build and platform specific sub directories of firefly/disk directory. For example if you build in the x86 checked Windows Server 2003 build environment, all the files will be placed under the firefly\disk\chk_wnet_x86\i386 directory. The target directory path for these files is controlled by the TARGETPATH variable specified in the common project file called project.mk.
<p> <LI>
Copy the .sys, .exe and the INF file (vhidmini.inf) to a floppy disk or a temporary directory on the target system.

<H3>INSTALLING   
 THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" 
SIZE=2><P>
To install the driver on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003: <p>
<OL>
<LI>Get Microsoft's USB Optical mouse and plug that into your target machine and make sure the mouse works. The drivers for this mouse comes with the operating system so the device will start working automatically when you plug in.
<LI>
Copy the firefly.sys and the INF file (firefly.inf) to a floppy disk or a temporary directory on the target system. 

<LI>Bring up the device manager (type devmgmt.msc in the Start/Run window and press enter).

<LI>Find the Microsoft Optical mouse under "Mice and other pointing devices"

<LI>Right click on the device and choose "Update Driver..."

<LI>Select the "Install from a list of specific location (Advanced)", and click Next.

<LI>Select "Don't search. I will choose the driver to Install" and click Next.

<LI>Click on "Have Disk..." and specify the floppy or temporary directory where the INF and the sys files are present.

<LI>The system will show "Shiny Things Firefly mouse" in the list of compatible hardware. Choose that and click Next.
<LI>You will get a warning about installing a driver that the system cannot verify whether it's compatible with your hardware. Ignore that and say Yes to installing the driver.

<LI>The system will go ahead and install the driver. At this point, you will get a warning dialog about installing an unsigned driver. Ignore that and click on "Continue Anyway" button.
<LI>The system will copy all the files and restart the mouse device to install the upper filter. Click on Finish button and you are ready to run the test app.

</OL>


To install the driver on Windows 2000: <p>

<OL>

<LI>
      Find the mouse device in the Device manager. On Windows 2000, this device might come up as a "HID compliant mouse" under "Mice and other pointing devices".

<LI>
      Double click on the device to bring up the properties dialog.

<LI>
      Go to the Driver Tab and click on "Update Driver..." button. Click Next.
<LI>
      Select "Display a list of the known driver..." option and click Next.

<LI>Click on "Have Disk..." and specify the floppy or temporary directory where the INF and the sys files are present.

<LI> Click Next. You will get warning about installing an unsigned driver. Click on Yes to continue the driver installation.


<LI>The system will copy all the files and restart the mouse device to install the upper filter. Click on Finish and close the Device manager property dialog. You are ready to run the test app.
 </OL>

<H3>TESTING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" 
SIZE=2><P>

Copy the flicker.exe to the target machine and run it from command line. The usage is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Usage: Flicker <-0 | -1 | -2> <p>
                -0 turns off light <p>
                -1 turns on light <p>
                -2 flashes light
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<B>Testing the DLL:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Copy the sauron.dll to the Windows Media player Visualization directory (C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\Visualizations).
<LI>Register the DLL with COM by calling "regsvr32 sauron.dll" in command shell.

<LI>Start the Windows Media player and click on "Now Playing". 

<LI>Right click on the Visualization window and you will see a menu item called "Sauron".

<LI>Choose either Firefly Bars or Firefly Flash and play some music.

<LI>You will see the mouse light dancing to the tune of the music.

<LI>You can unregister the DLL by calling "regsvr32 -u sauron.dll".
</OL>
