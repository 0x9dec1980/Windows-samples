<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
This sample is a working example of QIC157 Tape Minidriver. This module contains device-specific routines for QIC157 (ATAPI) compliant tape drives. <P>
<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
To build the sample, run the<B> build</B> command. The lib file Tape.lib is required to build the sample. <P>

Before you can use the sample, you need to install a tape drive that uses qic157.sys. The list of drives that use qic157.sys is given in Tape.inf and the %SystemRoot%\Inf directory. This file is used by the system to install. If you make any changes to Tape.inf, be sure to delete Tape.pnf, if it exists. 
<P>
To install the drive, shut down the machine, attach the drive, and boot. The drive will be detected and Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; 2000  will prompt for the qic157.sys driver. The driver will be copied into %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers. 
<P>
This sample has been tested on Alpha platforms. It has not been confirmed as 64-bit compliant. Plug and Play and Power Management are handled by lower drivers in the stack. 
<P>
Building this sample produces qic157.sys. Both free and checked versions are buildable. The sample has been tested with a binary that was built with Microsoft Visual® C++ 6.0. <P>
