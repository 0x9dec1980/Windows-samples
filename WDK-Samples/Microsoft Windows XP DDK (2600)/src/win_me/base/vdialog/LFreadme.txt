Windows Me DDK -
VDIALOG Legacy Free Release Notes
------------------------
Note: If you attempt to access the VDIALOG VxD simultaneously from a
DOS VM and from Windows you will encounter an error message. This 
message cannot be dismissed from a Legacy Free machine and will 
cause you to perform a power off and back on to regain the machine.

To workaround this issue, do not attempt to access the VDIALOG 
VxD from DOS and Windows within the same Windows Session.
