<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
This WDM driver implements standard functionality for an MPU-401 device. The driver is extremely small 
because it leverages code built into PortCls. It simply specifies and connects the appropriate 
port and miniport, which already exist in PortCls. The Msmpu401 driver is used by audio devices when 
the MPU-401 hardware is on a separate devnode from other audio functionality.  If the MPU-401 shares 
a devnode with other subdevices (such as PCM wave, in the Sb16 device), the built-in DMusUART miniport
can still be used, but an adapter that handles multiple subdevices must be written.  The Sb16 sample 
illustrates how this can be done.

<P>
If the built-in miniport is insufficient, a custom miniport can be built to handle any additional 
functionality. There are a number of miniport samples in the DDK: the Dmusuart, Ddksynth, Fmsynth and 
Uart samples show how to build miniports that interface to the DMus and MIDI ports; Sb16 and Ac97 
include custom wave miniports. Additionally, the Ddksynth, Sb16 and Ac97 samples contain the necessary 
code to connect the custom miniport into the driver.  If you choose to pursue this, try to follow the 
sample as closely as possible.  You will prevent unnecessary complexity by taking advantage of what 
PortCls will do for you.

<P>
This sample is compliant with x86, Alpha, iA64, and AXP64 platforms. 
This driver builds properly with Microsoft&#174; Visual C&#174; 6.0. Since the driver is a PortCls client, it is compliant with Plug and Play and Power 
Management. There are no known issues with this driver.<P>

<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" 
SIZE=2><P>
To build this sample, enter the free or checked build environment and run <B>build</B> from the 98ddk\src\audio 
directory, rather than the mpu401 subdirectory. This sample links with Stdunk.lib, which is also built if you run 
build from 98ddk\src\audio. Once built, this sample produces msmpu401.sys. In addition to the files in the 
directory, the following files are needed to build this sample:<p>
Portcls.lib<br>
Libcntpr.lib<br>
Ksguid.lib<br>
Stdunk.lib<br>
Dmusicks.h<br>
Dmusprop.h<br>
Dmusbuff.h<br>
Ks.h<br>
Ksdebug.h<br>
Ksmedia.h<br>
Portcls.h<br>
Unknown.h<br>
Wdm.h<p>
