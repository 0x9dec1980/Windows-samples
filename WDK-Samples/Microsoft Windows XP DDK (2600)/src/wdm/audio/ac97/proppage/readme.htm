<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE SAMPLE<br>
<br>
The private property is exposed as a filter property. As a result of this, we 
don't have to pass down a KSP_NODE structure but a KSPROPERTY structure (which 
is missing the node). Add properties to the topology filter if they are generic 
and not connected with a node.<br>
<br>
You can pass down additional information besides the KSPROPERTY structure. 
Whatever you add after the structure is passed to the topology handler. The 
&quot;Instance&quot; pointer points to the added data and the &quot;InstanceSize&quot; variable in 
the PPCPROPERTY_REQUEST structure contains the additional buffer length. The 
output buffer that was passed in the DeviceIoControl call is the &quot;Value&quot; pointer 
(and &quot;ValueSize&quot; variable).<br>
<br>
Use node properties (define your own GUID, attach that to the node like the 
KSPROPSETID_Audio is attached to for example volume nodes) if the property 
changes values of that node (special 3d node for example). Make sure you specify 
KSPROPERTY_TYPE_TOPOLOGY when you talk with a node and pass at least a KSP_NODE 
structure down. Everything passed after KSP_NODE is again accessible with the 
&quot;Instance&quot; and &quot;InstanceSize&quot; variables.</p>
