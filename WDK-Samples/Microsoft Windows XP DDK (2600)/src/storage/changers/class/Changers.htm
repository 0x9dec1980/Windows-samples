<FONT FACE="Verdana"><H2><A NAME="MYSAMPLE">Changer Class Device Driver Samples</A> </H2>
<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
The changer class device driver architecture is new to Windows 2000 and allows support for a new class of devices not natively supported in previous versions of Windows NT. These devices are referred to as <I>libraries</I>, <I>changers</I>, or <I>robots</I>, and allow automated mounting and dismounting of storage media into drives (disk, tape, optical, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, et cetera).<P>
To date, the market has been driven by proprietary software support, so the devices vary widely. We have provided several driver samples that illustrate the various ways that these devices can be supported. <P>
No INF file is needed to install this driver. This driver gets installed when a changer minidriver is installed. <P>
<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
The samples require that the Windows 2000 DDK be installed so that the required headers and libs are available.<P>
To build the samples individually, run <B>build</B> from the sample directory. The compiled binaries will be placed in the appropriate platform directory (i.e., i386 or ia64 or Alpha). <P>
<H3>TOOLS</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
The Changer Class test tools are part of our Hardware Compatibility Test suite and can be found on Microsoft’s <A HREF="www.microsoft.com">Web site</A>. These tests will verify that any developed driver supports the interfaces defined for this class driver architecture correctly. Note that the samples are based on production code but are not intended to replace the drivers in the Windows operating system.<P>
